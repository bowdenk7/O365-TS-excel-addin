### Overview ###
This is a project for a tutorial Microsoft Office Add-in for Excel. It interacts with data in Excel 2013 via Office.js, and renders a funnel chart on D3.js. This tutorial has been modified to use TypeScript. You can find the original [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Apps/tree/master/FunnelChart).
